SublimeJavaImports
==================

JavaImports is a Sublime Text plugin for automatically adding imports to your Java files. It resolves the package names by scanning through a source .zip or folder or a .jar file.

Installation
------------

The best way to install this is using [PackageControl](https://sublime.wbond.net)

Usage
-----

First you have to define your `java_import_path` in your settings. The best path to use is the src.zip in your Java JDK.
You can also use your android.jar as path to work with android classes.

To add an import either mark all class names to import and press `ctrl+alt+i` or just press `ctrl+alt+i` and then enter the class name.

To add a library to your project, in your `.sublime-project` add
<pre><code>"settings":
{
    "java_import_path":
    [
        "default/java/import/path/src.zip",
        "path/to/library.jar"
    ]
}
</code></pre>
